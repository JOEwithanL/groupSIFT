groupSIFT is a plugin for EEGLAB developed by Makoto Miyakoshi. Although this is a group-level solution to compute (it supports batch process for Tim Mullent's SIFT), integrate, and test effectivity connectivity (direct directed transfer function, dDTF, or renormalized partial directed coherence, rPDC) across independent components (ICs), it does not use STUDY. Instead, groupSIFT has its own data structure. This is due to the nature of data structure (5-D tensor that has from_IC, to_IC, time, freq, and ICs) and statistical approach (similar to that of Measure Projection, originally called Network Projection, proposed by Nima Bigdely-Shamlo). There are a couple of publications made using this plugin. For dedicated Wiki page, see https://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/GroupSIFT
